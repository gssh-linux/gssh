# GSSH
Currently under rebuild.
The app is now based on Electron for the GUI.
I know some of you may don't like it but, for us, the developers, it's easier to maintain and add more features to. 
Tell us what you think of this by opening an issue. Thanks!  

To-Do list: <br>
Reorganize releases to make them cleaner <br>
Start working using branches <br>
Automatically build electron artifacts <br>
